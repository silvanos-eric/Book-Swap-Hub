## Overview
The Book Swap Hub App is a full-stack web application that allows users to buy, sell, rent, and review books. It includes functionality for user authentication, book listings, leaving book reviews, and transaction management. The front end is built using React and styled with Bootstrap for a responsive design, while the backend is powered by Flask, handling API requests, database interactions, and authentication.

Users can sign up either as vendors or customers. vendors can list books for sale or rent, and customers can browse books, make purchases, and leave reviews.

## Features
- **User Roles**: Two roles - vendors (who can list books) and customers (who can buy or rent books).
- **Authentication**: User authentication using hashed passwords and JWT.
- **Book Listings**: vendors can add books with details like title, author, price, and condition.
- **Transactions**: Customers can buy or rent books, and the status of books (available, rented, sold) is updated accordingly.
- **Book Reviews**: Users can leave reviews and ratings (1-5) for books theyâ€™ve purchased or rented.
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap is used for styling, making the app mobile-friendly.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for secure user authentication.
